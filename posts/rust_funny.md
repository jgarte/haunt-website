summary: Rust jokes

A small collection of [Rust-lang](https://www.rust-lang.org/) jokes, sadly none of which I can claim credit for creating*:

```
Failure is not an Option<T>, it's a Result<T,E>.

In Rust, None is always an Option<_>.

Rust iterators are the best thing since &Bread[..].
```

*see [here](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/twir-quote-of-the-week/) for more pearls of witticism.
