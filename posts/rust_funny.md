A small collection of [Rust-lang](https://www.rust-lang.org/) jokes, mostly found in *Quote of the Week* on [users.rust-lang.org](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/twir-quote-of-the-week/).

```
Failure is not an Option<T>, it's a Result<T,E>.

In Rust, None is always an Option<_>.

Rust iterators are the best thing since &Bread[..].
```

I will add more to the collection as I find them!
