Source code for my personal website at [lewis-weinberger.github.io](https://lewis-weinberger.github.io). To build this website you need an installation of [Guile Scheme](https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/) and David Thompson's [Haunt](https://dthompson.us/projects/haunt.html) library, as well as [Guile CommonMark](https://github.com/OrangeShark/guile-commonmark). The site can then be built and served locally using:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/lewis-weinberger/haunt-website.git
$ cd haunt-website
$ haunt build
$ haunt serve
```
